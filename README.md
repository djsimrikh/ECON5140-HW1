# ECON 5140 - Homework 1, Problem 5

**Customer Purchase Prediction & Time Series Analysis**

This repository contains the code and output for Problem 5 (Part 2: Coding Problems) of ECON 5140 Homework 1.

## Contents

- **`ECON5140_HW1_Problem5.py`** – Full Python script (GLM + Time Series)
- **`OUTPUT.txt`** – Reference/sample output from the script
- **`figures/`** – Plots generated by the script (if you run it locally)

## Part A: Generalized Linear Models

- **A1** – Exploratory data analysis (box plots, means, correlation heatmap)
- **A2** – Linear Probability Model (OLS)
- **A3** – Logistic regression (coefficients, odds ratios, interpretation)
- **A4** – Predictions for new customers

## Part B: Time Series Analysis

- **B1** – Time series and seasonal subseries plots
- **B2** – Stationarity (rolling mean/std)
- **B3** – Autocorrelation function
- **B4** – STL decomposition
- **B5** – Remainder diagnostics

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy statsmodels
```

## How to run

```bash
python ECON5140_HW1_Problem5.py
```

To save output to a file:

```bash
python ECON5140_HW1_Problem5.py 2>&1 | tee my_output.txt
```

Plots are saved as PNG files in the current directory (e.g. `A1_boxplots.png`, `B4_stl.png`).
